This was quite a hectic week. I had just finished up my midterms and
right after I was bombarded with very difficult cs70 homework. Then
I figured that if I left at least 60 hours of work time, I would be able
to finish it, but I unfortunately made a false prediction. Meanwhile, my partner
still had to study for midterms during this time.
